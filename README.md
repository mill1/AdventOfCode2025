# Advent of Code 2025 — Solutions ⭐🎁✨

This repo holds my solutions for the puzzles of the **Advent of Code 2025**

## 🎄 What’s Inside?

Each puzzle lives in its own cozy C# class under `Puzzles/`, wrapped snugly inside an `IPuzzle` interface because even elves appreciate good organization.

The program boots into a tiny command-line menu which explains itself.

## 🔧 Running It

Clone the repo, then run:

`dotnet run`

## 🧬 Example Data

Each puzzle can run using either:

- Hand-crafted example data (as tradition demands), or
- Real input loaded from `Puzzles/Input/`
